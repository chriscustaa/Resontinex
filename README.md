# RESONTINEX Engine ‚Äì Self-Governing Cognitive Signal Orchestrator

RESONTINEX is a cognitive signal engine ‚Äî a modular intelligence system designed to orchestrate high-fidelity workflows using thermodynamic principles, trust enforcement, and entropy-aware architecture.

Built for real-world AI orchestration, agent routing, and systems automation, it provides a resilient cognitive substrate that preserves continuity, enforces structure, and compounds insight over time.

---

## üåê Why It Exists

Modern AI workflows are fragile. Agents forget. Threads drift. Output loses value.

RESONTINEX imposes directional structure on that chaos ‚Äî reducing entropy, scoring signal trustworthiness, and maintaining coherence across distributed reasoning systems. It's built to manage signal over time, not just output in the moment.

---

## üî¨ Thermodynamic Model

RESONTINEX treats cognition like a thermodynamic system. Every interaction is a signal with entropy, structure, and trust potential.

- High-entropy inputs are processed through `EntropyAuditor` to reduce noise and drift.
- Structured signals are scored by `TrustManager` to detect inflation and misalignment.
- `ContinuityEngine` ensures semantic thread integrity across time and agent boundaries.
- `InsightCollapser` compresses reasoning chains into reusable knowledge blocks.

This model enforces clarity, directional persistence, and value compounding ‚Äî even under chaotic input conditions.

## üß† Core Modules

| Module             | Purpose                                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `ContinuityEngine` | Preserves semantic thread across workflows and sessions  |
| `TrustManager`     | Scores signals for alignment, inflation, and drift       |
| `EntropyAuditor`   | Detects degradation, repetition, or system noise         |
| `InsightCollapser` | Compresses reasoning chains into reusable abstractions   |

All modules are composable, JSON-definable, and agent-agnostic. They can be embedded into n8n flows, local agent frameworks, or LLM-based reasoning chains.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Use Case: Land Intelligence Automation

A working implementation of RESONTINEX powers `Certi-Land‚Ñ¢`, a due diligence automation platform for land developers.

Example flow:
- Agent parses parcel metadata from CRM input
- Validates legal/utility constraints and contract risk
- Scores trust, flags entropy spikes (e.g. conflicting inputs)
- Compresses findings into contract-ready summaries for investor review

---

## üîç Other Use Cases

- Multi-agent orchestration (OpenAI, Claude, Grok, local LLMs)
- n8n-based task automation with entropy safeguards
- Long-form strategy systems with continuity guarantees
- Drift-aware AI interfaces (compliance, legal, financial ops)
- Cognitive workload management (resilience under pressure)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Fusion Configuration

RESONTINEX includes a fusion engine for cross-model orchestration with thermodynamic optimization. The fusion system enables seamless switching between models (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, Grok, Gemini, local GGUF) based on capability scores, cost factors, and performance metrics.

### Configuration Files

```
/configs/fusion/
  model_semantics_ledger.v0.1.0.json   # Cross-model capability mappings
  capability_profile.schema.json        # JSON Schema validation
  fusion_overlay.v0.3.txt              # Runtime parameters & rules

resontinex.config.yaml                  # Main configuration with paths
```

### Environment Overrides

```bash
export RESON_FUSION_LEDGER_PATH="./configs/fusion/model_semantics_ledger.v0.1.0.json"
export RESON_FUSION_OVERLAY_PATH="./configs/fusion/fusion_overlay.v0.3.txt"
export RESON_FUSION_SCHEMA_PATH="./configs/fusion/capability_profile.schema.json"
```

### Python Loader

```python
import os, json
from pathlib import Path

# Load fusion configuration
config_path = os.getenv("RESON_FUSION_LEDGER_PATH") or "./configs/fusion/model_semantics_ledger.v0.1.0.json"
with open(config_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    LEDGER = json.load(f)

# Access model capabilities
entropy_scores = LEDGER["cross_model"]["keyword_support"]["entropy_control"]
claude_score = entropy_scores["claude-3.5"]  # 0.89
```

### n8n Integration

```javascript
// Read Binary File ‚Üí ./configs/fusion/model_semantics_ledger.v0.1.0.json
// Move Binary Data (to JSON) ‚Üí downstream Set nodes
const entropySupport = $json.cross_model.keyword_support.entropy_control;
const optimalPairs = $json.fusion_recommendations.optimal_pairs;
```

### Ledger Management

Rebuild ledgers from profile data and bump semantic versions on change:

```bash
# Rebuild from profiles/ directory
python scripts/fuse-ledger.py --profiles-dir ./profiles

# Validate current ledger
python scripts/fuse-ledger.py --validate

# Dry run (show changes without writing)
python scripts/fuse-ledger.py --dry-run

# Force rebuild (ignore change detection)
python scripts/fuse-ledger.py --force
```

The script automatically detects changes, increments semantic versions, and maintains build artifacts in `/build/fusion/`.
