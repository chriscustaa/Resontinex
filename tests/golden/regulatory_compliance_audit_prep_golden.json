  "baseline_output": "For the upcoming GDPR compliance audit scheduled for 2025-08-15, you should prepare a comprehensive checklist covering all data processing activities, third-party processors, and user consent mechanisms. Focus on documenting the 12,847 active EU user accounts, reviewing the 23 identified data processing activities, and ensuring all third-party processor agreements are current. Update privacy policies if needed, review the two previous breach incidents for documentation completeness, and ensure the user consent management system is functioning properly. Prepare evidence of compliance measures and create a timeline for addressing any gaps identified during preparation.",
