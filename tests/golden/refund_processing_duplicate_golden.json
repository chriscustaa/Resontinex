  "baseline_output": "Based on the refund request for duplicate charges, I recommend processing a full refund for the duplicate transaction ($299.99) that occurred on 2025-08-01 at 10:16 UTC. The customer has been a loyal subscriber for 18 months with no previous refund requests, which supports their credibility. The duplicate charge appears to be a system processing error given the 1-minute interval between charges using the same payment method. Process the refund through the standard customer service workflow and add a note to the customer's account documenting the duplicate charge incident for future reference.",
