# RESONTINEX System Overview (Placeholder)

> 🚧 Full architecture and thermodynamic reasoning model coming soon.

This document will serve as the deep technical overview of the RESONTINEX Engine — a cognitive signal orchestration framework inspired by thermodynamic systems, trust auditing, and continuity enforcement.

It will include:

---

## 🔧 1. System Philosophy & Design Rationale
- Why cognition behaves like a thermodynamic system
- Problem of entropy in long-form LLM workflows
- Trust vs. structure tradeoff in agent-based automation

## 🧱 2. Core Module Roles
- `ContinuityEngine`: Preserves semantic flow and agent state
- `TrustManager`: Signal scoring for alignment/inflation
- `EntropyAuditor`: Detects drift, duplication, contradiction
- `InsightCollapser`: Compresses reasoning into reusable abstractions

## 🔄 3. Module Flow & Runtime Logic
- Signal intake → processing → scoring → routing
- Runtime hooks for integration into LLM chains, n8n, or local agents
- Configurable via `resontinex.json`

## 📈 4. Architectural Diagram
- Visual system map (insert from `/diagrams/`)
- Dataflow between modules
- Optional: Feedback loop arrows to show entropy cycles

## 🔬 5. Use Case Application: Certi-Land
- How RESONTINEX governs a land due diligence AI pipeline
- Signal scoring in legal/utility/parcel workflows
- Agent modularity + memory continuity

## ⚖️ 6. Design Tradeoffs & Constraints
| Tradeoff               | Resolution Strategy                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Drift vs. Precision     | Use of EntropyAuditor scoring             |
| Flexibility vs. Risk    | All modules composable + trust-weighted  |
| Agent freedom vs. structure | Enforced signal thresholds via config   |
