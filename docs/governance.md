# RESONTINEX Governance Layer

This document defines the internal governance mechanisms that ensure safe, transparent, and resilient orchestration within the RESONTINEX Engine.

## üîÑ Conflict Resolution Protocol (CRP)

When internal modules produce contradictory signals (e.g. `EntropyAuditor` detects noise, `TrustManager` greenlights trust), a **conflict resolution protocol** is triggered:

1. **First Responder Flag** ‚Äì The first module to raise a critical alert sets the resolution flow in motion.
2. **Module Quorum Vote** ‚Äì Each active module casts a vote weighted by priority (see Voting Map).
3. **Deferred Arbitration** ‚Äì If no resolution is reached in time, control is passed to `GateKit`, a meta-resolution layer.

### Voting Power Map

| Module             | Votes |
|--------------------|-------|
| EntropyAuditor     | 2     |
| TrustManager       | 2     |
| ContinuityEngine   | 1     |
| InsightCollapser   | 1     |

Quorum is defined as 3+ aligned votes or timeout resolution within 150ms.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Trust Inflation Dynamics

The `TrustManager` tracks both:
- **Alignment Score**: Relevance to prompt and prior state
- **Inflation Delta**: Drift between past and present signal confidence

### Risks
- **Adversarial Feedback**: Agents optimizing for inflated trust scores
- **Unvetted Overrides**: `external_override` flags must be authenticated (via `GateKit` or cryptographic signature)

## üß† Entropy Score Calibration

`semantic_drift_score` is normalized via:
- Token-level deltas (token_variance_delta)
- Embedding similarity decay
- Domain-specific entropy profiles (WIP)

Use-case profiles may vary entropy floors dynamically based on signal intent:
- `compliance`: low entropy tolerance
- `creative`: high entropy tolerance

## üîã Energy Governance

Each collapse or audit incurs cognitive compute cost.  
RESONTINEX tracks:
- `energy_budget_per_signal` (auto-estimated or bounded)
- Max collapse attempts per signal (default: 3)
- Adaptive backoff if latency exceeds 200ms

---

## üîç Transparency + Provenance (Planned)

- Cryptographic hashes of `canonical_form` versions
- Log of trust score changes with source attribution
- Snapshot of entropy delta per signal event

---

This document is evolving as RESONTINEX scales. Future layers may include:
- Role-based arbitration
- GateKit meta-governance plugin spec
- Public ledger of collapsed insights
